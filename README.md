AppArmor is able to restrict what programs can do and access based on policies for those programs.

See [AppArmor in the Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse).

By default (e.g. no [auditd] installed) log messages from AppArmor are
logged via syslog to the kernel facility which usually ends up under
`/var/log/kern.log`.

[auditd]: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=auditd
